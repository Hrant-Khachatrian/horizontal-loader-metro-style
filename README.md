# Horizontal loader in pure CSS animations

This is a horizontal loader similar to the ones in Windows 8 apps (Metro style). 

No JavaScript. No GIFs. Just Pure CSS. The code is self-explanatory.

Works in every browser that supports CSS Animations: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation

## Usage
 
1. Download and link to `horizontal-loader.css` in your HTML
2. Add the loader div similar to this:
    ```html
        <div class="loader">
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
        </div>
    ```
3. Test in your favorite browser (your favorite browser was not released before 2012, right?)
